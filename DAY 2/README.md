**General Formulas to solve problems related to Arithmetic Progressions:**/
If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference:


1.nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d./
2.Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP./
3.Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ].


General Formulas to solve problems related to Geometric Progressions:

If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘r’ is the common ratio:
1.nth term of a GP = a*r^n-1.
2.Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP.
3.Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
4.Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (r^ – 1)] / [r – 1].
5.Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).

Formula for finding Median :
If the count of numbers is odd: After sorting the sequence,
Median = {(N+1)/2}th value.
If the count of numbers is even: After sorting the sequence,
Median  =  Average of (N/2)th and {(N/2) + 1}th value.


Important Properties of Permutation:
n P n = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*......*1 = n!.
n P 0 = n! / n! = 1.
n P 1 = n.
n P n-1 = n!.
n P r/n P r-1 = n - r + 1.

Important Properties of Combination:
n C 0 = n C n = 1.
n C r = n C n-r.
n C r + n C r-1 = n+1 C r.
n * n-1 C r-1 = (n - r + 1)* n C r-1.
