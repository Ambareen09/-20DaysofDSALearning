In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. 
The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime.
This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime


1.Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
2.Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
3.Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
4.Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
