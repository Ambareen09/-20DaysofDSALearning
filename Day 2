1. FINIDING DIGITS IN A NUMBER

Given an integral number N. The task is to find the count of digits present in this number.

Let's say:
N = 1854

Number of digits in N here is 4 and,
the digits are: 1,8,5,4.

Naive solution:
int count(int n)
{
  c=0;
  while(n!=0)
  {
    n=n/10;
    ++c;
   }
   return c;
  }
  
  Time complextity: O(c)
  
  Logarithmic solution:
  
  int count(int n)
  {
    return floor(log10(n)+1)
   }
   
   Derivation: Suppose the number of digits in the number N is K.

Therefore, we can say that:
10^K-1 <= N < 10^K
Applying base-10 logarithm to both sides in the above equation, we get:
K-1 <= log10(N) < K.

or, K - 1 + 1 <= log10(N) + 1 < K + 1
or, K <= log10(N) + 1 < K + 1 
Therefore,
K = floor(log10(N) + 1)
  *Time complextity: O(1)*
  
  
General Formulas to solve problems related to Arithmetic Progressions: If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference:
1.nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d.
2.Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP.
3.Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ].


General Formulas to solve problems related to Geometric Progressions:

If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘r’ is the common ratio:
1.nth term of a GP = a*r^n-1.
2.Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP.
3.Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
4.Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (r^ – 1)] / [r – 1].
5.Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).

Formula for finding Median :
If the count of numbers is odd: After sorting the sequence,
Median = {(N+1)/2}th value.
If the count of numbers is even: After sorting the sequence,
Median  =  Average of (N/2)th and {(N/2) + 1}th value.


Important Properties of Permutation:
n P n = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*......*1 = n!.
n P 0 = n! / n! = 1.
n P 1 = n.
n P n-1 = n!.
n P r/n P r-1 = n - r + 1.

Important Properties of Combination:
n C 0 = n C n = 1.
n C r = n C n-r.
n C r + n C r-1 = n+1 C r.
n * n-1 C r-1 = (n - r + 1)* n C r-1.
