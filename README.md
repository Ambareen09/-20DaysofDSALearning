Welcome to my **first** GitHub repository.\
I'll be sharing my journey of daily learning of _Data Structures and Algorithms_ for 100 days.\
**Data Structures and Algorithms** are integral part of a Computer Science Engineer's life. It helps alot to _understand logics and build a skill for problem solving ability within ourselves_.\
A lot of beginners **avoid** learning Data Structures and Algorithms because itâ€™s **complicated** and they think that there is no use of all the above stuff in real life. I did the same mistake and went for competetive coding directly, which resulted in loss of interest from coding. I delayed and left coding for major part of my 1st year.\
Now I've started my 2nd year of enginnering and have taken the basic road towards coding.

All my learnings are end product of *DSA Self paced course*.

**All contributions are welcomed.**
